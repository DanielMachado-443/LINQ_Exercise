  C# LINQ Exercise
</p>

---

## Description

- This is a LINQ exercise application that reads a .csv file and prints the results of some queries using the .Net LINQ libraries to simplify the task.

## How to start

- In order to start seeing the code, you must have Visual Studio installed with C# packages

## About the code

- As you should notice, if we take the first method as an example, we can see that we have a static method called firstQuery (red square), receiving a IEnumarable object AND a double containing a query relevant data. The return then will be an IEnumerable object with the employees emails by their email's first letter alphabetic order
